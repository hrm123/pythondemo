We use the IBM SLATE-30M (ENG) model to generate embeddings for the transcript chunks. This function initializes the embedding model, which converts 
the textual data into numerical vectors that can be utilized for various natural language processing tasks, such as similarity calculations, 
clustering, and machine learning model training.
Embeddings are dense vector representations of text, where similar pieces of text are mapped to nearby points in the vector space. This allows models 
to understand the semantic relationships between words and phrases, making embeddings crucial for tasks like information retrieval, clustering, and classification.
The SLATE-30M model is specifically designed for English language embeddings, providing high-quality representations that capture the semantic meaning of the input text.

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library designed for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, enabling rapid retrieval of nearest neighbors in high-dimensional spaces. This function creates a FAISS index from a list of text chunks using the specified embedding model. By converting text chunks into embeddings and indexing them with FAISS, we can quickly find the most similar chunks based on cosine similarity or other distance metrics. This is particularly useful in applications such as information retrieval, recommendation systems, and natural language understanding.

The function takes two parameters:

chunks: A list containing the text chunks that have been processed and are ready for indexing. These chunks typically represent segments of text that need to be compared or searched.

embedding_model: The model used to generate embeddings for the text chunks. This model transforms the chunks into numerical vectors that represent their semantic meaning.

In this section, we define a prompt template for the language model to summarize a YouTube video transcript.

The function returns a PromptTemplate object configured to accept the transcript as an input variable.

Setting up a Gradio interface
This section describes the setup of a Gradio interface for interacting with a YouTube video, allowing users to fetch its transcript, summarize it, or ask questions based on the content of the video. The interface is built using Gradio's Blocks API, which facilitates the creation of interactive web applications with minimal code.
Description
Input field: A textbox (video_url) is created for users to enter the URL of the YouTube video they want to analyze.

Output fields: Two additional textboxes, summary_output and answer_output, are used to display the generated summary and answers to user questions, respectively. A question_input textbox allows users to type their queries regarding the video content.

Buttons: Two buttons, summarize_btn and question_btn, are included to allow users to trigger the summarization of the video or to ask a specific question about it.

Transcript status: A textbox (transcript_status) displays feedback to the user regarding the status of the transcript fetching process, indicating whether it was successful or if there were issues (for example, invalid URL).

Button actions: The summarize_btn is linked to the summarize_video function, which takes the YouTube URL as input and returns the summary to summary_output. The question_btn is linked to the answer_question function, which takes both the YouTube URL and user question as inputs and returns the answer to answer_output.

Launch configuration: Finally, the interface.launch(server_name="0.0.0.0", server_port=7860) line starts the Gradio application, enabling users to access it using a web browser on their local server.
